# **2. Overview**

The game of Belote is played with a **32-card deck**, consisting of 7, 8, 9, 10, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces, with the four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. It pits two teams of two players against each other: North/South versus East/West.

The game is played over several hands (also called tricks) and ends when a team reaches or exceeds a pre-defined number of points, or after a pre-defined number of hands. A hand consists of several phases:

- The deal,
- The bidding,
- The play of the cards,
- Scoring.

---

# **3. The Deal**

## 3.1. The Dealer

The first dealer is chosen by drawing lots. For the next hand, the dealer will be the player to their right, and so on.

## 3.2. Shuffling the Cards

The deck must be shuffled before each deal. The dealer picks up the 32 cards face down and shuffles them before placing the deck face down on the table.

## 3.3. The Cut

The player to the left of the dealer cuts the deck in two, without counting the number of cards. **Each pile must contain at least 3 cards**. The dealer closes the cut.

## 3.4. The Deal

The dealer deals 8 cards to each player, **in counterclockwise order, starting with the player to their right**, in one of the following ways:

- 3 cards, then 2, then 3
- 3 cards, then 3, then 2
- 2 cards, then 3, then 3

---

# **4. Bidding**

## 4.1. Bidding Round

Players take turns starting with the player to the right of the dealer. Each player may:

### _Pass_

A player passes by saying "I pass," with no other phrase allowed unless agreed upon by both teams beforehand. A player who passes once may bid later if given the opportunity. If all four players pass without bidding, the hand ends with no points scored.

> The dealer gathers the cards and passes them to the player to their right, who will be the new dealer.

### _Bid_

A player places a bid by clearly stating the number of points they commit their team to achieving, along with the suit they choose as trump.

The bid must be at least **80, a multiple of 10, and greater than the previous bid**.

Instead of a point value, a player may **at any time** declare a "capot," committing their team to win all eight tricks. No bid can exceed the capot; from then on, the opposing team may only pass or counter.

The bidding contract must always be announced in the same way: first the value (80, 90, 100…), followed by the suit (spades, hearts…), e.g., "90 hearts."

> Phrases like "20 more," "10 more," etc., are prohibited.

It is not possible to bid on your own previous bid: the bidding round ends when, after a bid or counter, the next three players pass.

### _Counter_

A player may counter an opponent's bid, casting doubt on their ability to fulfill the contract, by saying "I counter."

> You can only counter when it's your turn to speak (you cannot counter "on the fly").

A counter locks in the contract, preventing further bids.

**The hand’s score will be multiplied by 2.**

### _Re-counter_

When a team has countered, the opposing team has the option to re-counter by saying "I re-counter." The bidding round ends immediately.

**The hand’s score will be multiplied by 4.**

## 4.2. Contract

By taking the contract, the player commits their team (the takers) to fulfill two conditions, with the play of the cards based on the trump suit chosen:

- Achieving or exceeding the points bid or winning all eight tricks if a capot is declared,
- Scoring more points than the opposing team (the defenders).

The points include:

- Points won from the tricks,
- Possible Belote points,
- Any announced points.

---

# **5. The Play of the Cards**

The play consists of eight tricks (or "levées") of four cards.

## 5.1. Progression

The player to the right of the dealer plays the card of their choice: this is the opening card. The suit of the opening card sets the suit that must be followed.

The other three players each play a card in turn, always counterclockwise, following these rules. The trick is won by the player who played the highest card in the trump suit or, if none, in the leading suit. This player leads the next trick, and so on.

**Any revealed card must be played**, unless allowed otherwise by the opponents. Tricks are always collected by the same player from each team during the entire hand and stacked in the order they were played. The last trick can be viewed by any player until the next trick has been collected.

Once all cards have been played, scoring is done.

## 5.2. Rules

- You must **always** follow the leading suit if you have cards in it. If the leading suit is trump, you must play a higher trump card than any already played, if possible.

- If you don’t have a card in the leading suit and your partner is the winner of the trick (i.e., they have played the highest card), you may play any card. You may also play a trump card if you choose.

- If you don’t have a card in the leading suit and your partner has not won the trick or hasn’t played yet, you must play a trump card if you have one. If not, you may play any card.

    Note: If an opponent has already played a trump card, and you only have lower trump cards, you are **not** required to play one (you "discard" it instead).

- When you are forced to play a trump card, either because it’s the leading suit or because you must cut, you must always play a trump card higher than any already on the table, even if it’s not in your best interest. If that’s impossible, you may play a lower trump card.

- When your partner has cut an opponent’s card and you only have trump cards left, you are not required to play a higher trump card. This is the only case, which is quite rare, where a lower trump card is allowed.

# **6. Order and Value of Cards**

The order and value of cards vary depending on whether they are trump or not. The following tables show the order and value of the cards in descending order.

| Card    | Trump         | Non-Trump    |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| _Ace_   | 11 points     | 11 points    |
| _Ten_   | 10 points     | 10 points    |
| _King_  | 4 points      | 4 points     |
| _Queen_ | 3 points      | 3 points     |
| _Jack_  | **20 points** | **2 points** |
| _Nine_  | **14 points** | **0 points** |
| _Eight_ | 0 points      | 0 points     |
| _Seven_ | 0 points      | 0 points     |

---

# **7. Belote and Rebelote**

When a player holds **the King and Queen of trumps**, they have "Belote," which gives their team a **20-point bonus**.

To be valid, this must be announced by saying "Belote" when playing the first card (either the Queen or the King), and then "Rebelote" when playing the second.

> If either term is omitted, Belote is not counted.

**A correctly announced Belote is invincible: the point bonus is awarded even if the team falls short.**

---

# **8. Announcements**

Belote Contrée is always played without announcements.

---

# **9. Dix de Der and Capot**

## 9.1. Dix de Der

The team that wins the last trick receives a 10-point bonus for that trick. This is the rule of "Dix de Der," with "der" being short for "dernier pli" (last trick). The total points in the game are therefore 162, including the "Dix de Der."

## 9.2. Capot

In the case of a capot, meaning all eight tricks won by the same team, the Dix de Der is worth 100 points, bringing the total to 252 points.

---

# **10. Scoring**

## 10.1. Hand Result

When the 8 tricks have been played, the score is calculated. Each team totals its points:

- The number of points in the tricks won by the team,
- The Dix de Der,
- Belote/Rebelote.

### _10.1.1. Successful Contract_

The contract is successful if both conditions below are met:

- The takers obtain a **total equal to or greater than the bid OR win all eight tricks if a capot was requested**.

- The takers score more points

than the defenders.

### _10.1.2. Unsuccessful Contract_

If a team does not fulfill its contract, the **opponents win the hand** and score the number of points of the winning tricks. The score for the hand is subtracted from the score of the team that failed the contract.

---

# **11. End of the Game**

The game continues until one team reaches or exceeds a pre-defined score (usually **1000 points**). Once this threshold is passed, the team is declared the winner.
